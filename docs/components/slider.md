Provide a localized accessibility label. The component preserves native screen-reader and keyboard semantics, the shared touch target, Dynamic Type or platform font scaling, reduced motion, reduced transparency and high contrast.

## Examples

```swift
CoolSlider(.init(label: "Slider", accessibilityLabel: "Slider"))
```

```kotlin
CoolSlider(props = CoolComponentProps(label = "Slider"))
```

```html
<cool-slider label="Slider" accessibility-label="Slider" />
```
